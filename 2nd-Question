//Here are some other Approaches by which we can solve this problem
So, basically i know these 3 approach to solve this problem . Find my these approach

1. I solved this problem by simply approach like break the given array in two parts separated by 'k' and then simply prints the second part before and then the first part.

2. One other solution can be - Take a new array and then divide the given array into two parts as i discussed in approach 1, and the strore the arrays element in that new array and then print the new array.

3. We can also solve this problem using recursion by making functions.

4. one more approach is to rotate all the elements of the array in k steps by rotating the elements by 1 unit in each step.
